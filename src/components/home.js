      <div className='about'>
      I am a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota's coding bootcamp. 
      I greatly enjoyed the intensive  learning experience and plan to continue expanding my technical skills and knowledge. 
      Prior to my coding experience and education, I spent a year working in the Minnesota Conservation Corps, which involved everything from the removal of invasive plant species to tree felling to wildland firefighting. 
      Currently I work in the service industry as an assistant manager. I am ready to grow in my web development abilities and enhance my skills, I wish to join a positive and supportive team where I can work hard, gain experience and contribute to shared goals.</div>
