        My name is Sam Barsuhn and I am a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota's coding bootcamp.
        I have been interested in coding for as long as I can remember although it was just recently that I decided to put in the work to actually learn how to do it.
        Since that day I have fallen in love with coding and despite many moments of frustration I have continued to enjoy the learning experience and I plan to continue to expand my knowledge. 
        Before I started coding I worked in the Minnesota Conservation Corps, that involved everything from the removal of invasive plant species and tree felling to wildland firefighting.
        Currently I work in the service industry but I hope to break into web developement in the coming months as I continue to enhance my skills.</div>
